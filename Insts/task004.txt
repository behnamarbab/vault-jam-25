- Remove the collisions for the buttons
- The buttons don't change the colors, it should do it as intended
- When the player dies (falls off the screen or collides with an enemy), the game should restart
- The fading only works on walking/moving of objects on each other. So, if the player stands on a platform, the platform should not fade out.
