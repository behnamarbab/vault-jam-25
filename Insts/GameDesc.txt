Version: 0.0.2

Mechanics:
- When a fading is about to happen, the fading object fades out over time. So for instance, it takes some time (a variable, default value 4 seconds) of constant contact to fade out an object.

-------------------------------
Version: 0.0.3

Mechanics:
- The fade value of each object remains the same after the fade process is finished.
- The fade process should only happen when the objects are moving on each other.
- The buttons should not be collidable.

-------------------------------

Version: 0.0.5

Mechanics:
- Update in the fading mechanics:
    - An object (other than the player) fades, if the player on it has a same color from it.
    - The player fades out if it touches an object with a different color from it.
    - If the player fades out completely, the game is over.
    - If the player loses, even when it falls of the platforms out of the scene, the game is over.
    - When the game is over, the level restarts.

-------------------------------

Version: 0.0.6

Mechanics:
- Ignore the orders of the colors.
- The color change should change the color of the player to the color of the button, not the next color in the order.

Main Menu:
- Create a main menu in which I can select the level to play.
- Level design documentation.
    - The format of a level should be in a proper formatting, preferably a JSON file.
    - The different objects of the game are located in the grid of the scene.

-------------------------------
Version: 0.0.7

Mechanics:
- There is no Reset button.
- Whatever the button's color is, the player's color changes to that color.
- Each object should have a customizable fading rate. (default value 4 seconds, changeable in the level design)

-------------------------------
Version: 0.0.8

Mechanics:
- There are boxes that can be pushed, and also follow the fading rules.
- There are areas (as shown and distinguished in background) that when the player enters it, the player's fade starts returning to the default value, based on the area's fade time value. (so a full fade time of 4 seconds, will return to the default value in maximum 4 seconds if the player had fade value of close to 0)

-------------------------------
Version: 0.0.9

Mechanics:
- Airborne Fading: The player character fades while not on a platform. Airborne fading is triggered by vertical movement (jumping or falling), while ground-based fading continues to be triggered by horizontal movement.
