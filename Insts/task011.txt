change level 3:
The player character must be blue.

There must be two platforms with a visible gap between them.

The first platform must be blue.

The second platform must be green.

When the player reaches the end of the first platform, that platform should gradually fade out.

Because there is a gap between the platforms, the player must jump to reach the second platform.

While the player is in the air, the fading effect should depend on the time spent airborne (longer time in air = more fading).

When the player reaches the end of the second platform, that platform should also gradually fade out.
